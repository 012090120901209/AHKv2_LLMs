# Welcome to the AHK v2 LLMs Lab

This documentation area mirrors a Docusaurus site experience and highlights how to:

- Organize prompts and expectations for AutoHotkey v2 experiments
- Explain how to contribute your own markdown content
- Reference the purpose of each test when training LLM-based agents

## Add new pages

Drop additional markdown files anywhere inside the `docs/` directory and they will automatically appear in the navigation sidebar.
