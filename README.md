# AHK v2 LLMs

A lightweight Docusaurus site for organizing AutoHotkey v2 benchmarking content, blogs, and docs. Markdown-first authoring means you can drop files into `docs/` or `blog/` and they become new pages automatically.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run start    # local dev server
npm run build    # production build
```

## Adding new content

- **Docs**: add `.md` or `.mdx` files anywhere inside `docs/`. Sidebar navigation is autogenerated.
- **Blog**: add markdown files inside `blog/`. Use frontmatter for titles, tags, and publishing dates.
- **Static assets**: place files inside `static/` to serve them from the site root.
